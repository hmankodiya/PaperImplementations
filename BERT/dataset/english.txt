is everything all right at home?
is it a compliment or an insult?
is lunch included in this price?
is someone knocking on the door?
is something bothering you, tom?
is something else going on here?
is that supposed to cheer me up?
is that what you want me to say?
is that why you want to hurt me?
is that why you want to kill me?
is the chairman going to resign?
is there a hospital around here?
is there an information counter?

it seems that he knows about it.
it used to be nearly impossible.

it's like being in a candy shop.
it's more complicated than that.
it's no use asking me for money.
it's not about the money, is it?
it's not an either-or situation.
it's not for the faint of heart.
it's nothing short of a miracle.
it's nothing to get upset about.
it's possible, but not probable.
it's true that he saw a monster.
it's two o'clock in the morning.
